# Vehicle-classification-with-Engine-Sound-using-Neural-Network
In the research reported in this paper, we studied the efficacy of the LVQ algorithm in classifying engine noises from household cars. We note that the accuracy rate of LVQ is only satisfactory and there is still a considerable amount of tweaking that the model requires before it is implementable for any of its use cases (toll plazas, car parkings, etc). One prominent restriction is collecting high quality audio samples of engine noise from regular street cars. To automate it is difficult and to do so manually is time intensive. This research suggests that while the LVQ algorithm has a lot of potential for classifying time based signals there is a long way to go before State of the Art (SotA) automobile engine noise classification is achieved using this technique.
